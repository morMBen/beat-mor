### About the project:
- Proplem - Music composers who play drum machines encounter the problem that each drum machine comes with built-in sounds, in cases where there is an option to change the sounds the choice is from existing sounds and not the personal sounds of the composers themselves.
- Solution - A simple-to-play music creation system that creators can build their own drum machine, select sounds (from the computer or sounds saved by other creators) and the colors of the pads and share with everyone. This way any user who logs in can play on everyone's machines and hear their tunes easily and also save and share tunes by one creator on another creator's machine.
