### About the project:
- Proplem:
    * Music composers who play drum machines encounter the problem that each drum machine comes with built-in sounds, in cases where there is an option to change the sounds the choice is from existing sounds and not the personal sounds of the composers themselves.
- Solution:
     * A simple-to-play music creation system that creators can build their own drum machine, select sounds (from the computer or sounds saved by other creators) and the colors of the pads and share with everyone. This way any user who logs in can play on everyone's machines and hear their tunes easily and also save and share tunes by one creator on another creator's machine.

    - At the top left is the sequencer that runs according to the beat (when turned on). In each line there are eight boxes that can be filled with sounds.
!! It is important to note that each sound can be anywhere on the sequencer even several in parallel.
    -  At the top right are the 24 sounds from which you can choose, as soon as you press one pad it will be highlighted. If the current pad has already been injected into the sequencer a gift mark will appear indicating that this pad is running. If we press the pad in this position the stop sign will appear again and the sounds of the current pad will remain on the sequencer but will not be heard.
    - At the bottom right, turn on, off, keep pace, clear the sequencer, and reset the knobs. The novices on this side only affect one sound, the sound that is currently highlighted.
    - On the bottom left, an exit button and novices that control all the sounds together.
